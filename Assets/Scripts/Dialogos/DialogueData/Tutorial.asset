  - ... Okay, this is kinda embarrasing.
  - 'You know, here is where you should choose

    your first Dragon.'
  - 'But the developer has no idea how to draw

    nor time to do them.'
  - 'So, instead, you''ll be assigned one Dragon.

    Take good care of it.'
  - 'You move with WASD, and you may get

    new Dragons once you beat the dungeons.'
  - 'But beware. If any of your Dragons is defeated,

    your game will be over.'
  - Good luck!
